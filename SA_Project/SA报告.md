## Abstract

Monogame is a cross-platform, hardware accelerated API providing graphics, audio, game state management, input, and a content pipeline for importing assets. Unlike most game engines, monogame does not provide or impose any pattern or project structure. While this means that developers are free to organize their code as they like, it also means that a bit of setup code is needed when first starting a new project. The open source project started from 2009, created by an active member of the XNA community with the goal of porting simple 2D XNA games to mobile devices. In early 2014 stewardship of the MonoGame project was handed off to Tom Spilman and Steve Williams who currently lead the project. Now it contains 11,910 commits, has released 13 times and 251 different contributors have helped to perfect the monogame. By using MonoGame and targeting the UWP platform youâ€™ll be able to create 2d and 3d games for hundreds of millions of Windows 10 PCs and the whole Xbox One family, including the upcoming Project Scorpio. This	chapter	studies Monogame	by	looking	at	its	architecture,	and	by	looking	at	the	system	through	different viewpoints	and	perspectives.
